1.0  INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1  ABOUT THE PLUGIN
-----------------------

Zombie:Reloaded remake of Zombie Mod with a lot of new features and
improvements. It's made for a Counter-Strike: Source server and runs on a
powerful scripting platform called SourceMod.


1.2  GAME OBJECTIVES
----------------------

The objectives is to change the game into humans versus zombies. Humans try
to survive by camping, barricading and hiding. Zombies try to zombify humans
by using their knife.

At a random time after the round starts, one or more random humans are turned
into zombies. Zombies have certain advantages as running faster and more
health points. Humans have huge amounts of ammo (or unlimited), and their
bullets knock back zombies. A lot more attributes can be adjusted for both
zombies and humans in different classes.

2.0  INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1  REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Zombie: Reloaded requires that the following stuff is installed on the server:

    1.  Metamod:Source - A simplified API for server plugins. The original
        Zombie Mod is run on this one. It makes it easier for developers to
        make plugins like SourceMod:
        
            <http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_Metamod:Source>

    2.  SourceMod - A scripting platform:

            <http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod>
            <http://wiki.alliedmods.net/index.php/Category:SourceMod_Documentation>

    3.  ZRTools extension (bundled). Provides some extra functions needed by
        Zombie:Reloaded. See Plugin Installation (2.2).


2.2  PLUGIN INSTALLATION
--------------------------

Extract the content of the zip file into "cstrike/" on the server.

This plugin is often confused by Zombie Mod, which is actually ovbious since
Zombie:Reloaded is a SourceMod alternative to Zombie Mod.


2.3  TEST RUN
---------------

The plugin should work with default configuration. Start the server and join a
team. Once the round starts there sould be some messages at the chat with
"[ZR]". Or type "!zmenu" in the chat to bring up the zombie menu to confirm
that the plugin is running.

Next check error logs from SourceMod and look if there are any entries from
"zombiereloaded.smx". If the plugin doesn't work at all or there are error
logs, see Troubleshooting at section 5.0.


3.0  CONFIGURATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.1  UNDERSTANDING SYNTAX
---------------------------

In this manual commands or paths may be written in a certain style that tells
how to use it.

Note that the style itself is not written, but it's used as an indicator to
tell if a parameter is optional or not.

Example syntax of a command:

    zr_class_modify <classname|"zombies"|"humans"|"admins"> <attribute> <value> [is_multiplier]

Some paths may look like:

    cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/<mapname>.cfg

How to read syntaxes like this is explained below.


3.1.1  OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

Optional parameters is not required and usually have a default value or action.
They are marked with brackets.

Example:

    zr_somecommand [number]

Usage examples:

    zr_somecommand
    zr_somecommand 10


3.1.2  REQUIRED PARAMETERS

Required parameters must be specified for the command to function. Usually if
no parameters are written the command replies with some info about the syntax.

Less than (<) and greather than (>) symbols marks required parameters.

Examples:

    zr_somecommand <number>
    zr_infect <target>

Usage examples:

    zr_somecommand 100
    zr_infect "unnamed"


3.1.3  MULTIPLE OPTIONS IN THE SAME PARAMETER

Some commands have parameters that support multiple pre defined options.
Usually it's specifying a name, a index or a predefined value. Each option is
separated by a "|" symbol. Only one of the options listed is used in a command.

Example:

    zr_do_something <index|name|"all">

Usage examples:

    zr_do_something 1
    zr_do_something "all"
    zr_do_something "unnamed"


3.1.4  TEXT AS PARAMETERS

Since parameters are separated by spaces, text (strings) should be quoted. It's
a good habit to do this on all string parameters to avoid parsing mistakes.

Example:

    zr_infect "unnamed" "player"
    zr_do_something "example text. test."

Example of bad usage:

    zr_do_something example text. test.
    
The last example actually have 3 parameters while it should be only one. This
may cause unexpected results and is an example of why strings should be quoted.


3.2  CONFIGURATION FILES
--------------------------

These are the default configuration files. The paths are relative to the
"cstrike" folder.

    Type:           File:
    ===========================================================================
    Main conf.      cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/zombiereloaded.cfg
    Map conf.       cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/<mapname>.cfg
    Post map conf.  cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/<mapname>.post.cfg
    Hitgroup conf.  addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/hitgroups.txt
    Class conf.     addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/playerclasses.txt
    Weapon conf.    addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/weapons.txt
    Download list   addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/downloads.txt
    Model list      addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/models.txt

The post map configuration file is executed after all features of ZR is done
loading. Commands that modify loaded data must be put in post configuration
files. How to configure each file is explained in their own sections.


3.3  LOGGING
--------------

The log system used in Zombie:Reloaded is pretty powerful and customizable.
It's based on logging flags and a module filter.

The flags tell what kind of events to log. Those flags are stored as a numeric
value in a bit field where each bit tell wether to log a certain event or not.
See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field> for technical details.

The module filter is a list of modules to enable log events from. This filter
gives extra control of what stuff to log. Use console commands below in the
main configuration file to add or remove modules to the filter.

These commands might not work properly until bug 3828 in SourceMod is fixed
(http://bugs.alliedmods.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3828). It's a bug where console
commands in plugin configuration files are executed late so a command like
zr_log_add_module is too late.

There are console variables for different log settings and exceptions. Place
them in the main configuration file.

Console variables:

    Console variable:                   Default:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_log                              "1"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Enable logging of events in the plugin. Fatal errors or errors are
        independendt on this setting and always logged.
        
        Options:
        0 or 1
    
    zr_log_flags                        "3"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        A bit field that specify what event types to log.
        
        Options:
        Number - See Log Flags (3.3.1)
    
    zr_log_module_filter                "0"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Enable module filtering. Only log events from listed modules will be 
        logged. Use console commands below to add or remove modules from the
        filter.
        
        Options:
        0 or 1
    
    zr_log_ignore_console               "1"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Don't log events triggered by console that are executed by the console
        itself, like commands in configs. Enable this command to avoid spamming
        logs with events like weapon restrictions.
        
        Options:
        0 or 1
    
    zr_log_print_admins                 "0"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Print log events to admin chat in addition to the log file.
        
        Options:
        0 or 1
    
    zr_log_print_chat                   "0"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Print log events to public chat in addition to the log file.
        
        Options:
        0 or 1

Console commands:

    Syntax:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_log_add_module <module> [modules...]
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Adds one or more modules to the module filter. Use short module names,
        see List Of Modules (3.3.2).
        
        Parameters:
            module      Name of the module to add.
            modules     Additional modules to add.
    
    zr_log_remove_module <module> [modules...]
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Removes one or more modules from the module filter. Use short module
        names, see List Of Modules (3.3.2).
        
        Parameters:
            module      Name of the module to remove.
            modules     Additional modules to remove.
    
    zr_log_list
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Lists current log flag settings and module filtering settings.


3.3.1  LOG FLAGS

    Flag:          Bit No.: Value:  Description:
    ===========================================================================
    LOG_CORE_EVENTS       1 1       Log events from the plugin core like config
                                    validation and other messages.
    LOG_GAME_EVENTS       2 2       Log admin commands, console commands, and
                                    game related events from modules like,
                                    suicide attempts and weapon restrictions.
    LOG_PLAYER_COMMANDS   3 4       Log events that are triggered by players,
                                    like chat triggers, teleporting and class
                                    changes.
    LOG_DEBUG             4 8       Log debug messages, if any. Usually only
                                    developers enable this log flag.
    LOG_DEBUG_DETAIL      5 16      Log additional debug messages with more
                                    details. May cause spam depending on module
                                    filter settings. Usually only developers
                                    enable this log flag.

To combine several logging flags use the sum of their values. The default
value is 3, which is these log flags:

    LOG_CORE_EVENTS + LOG_GAME_EVENTS
    1 + 2

Most server setups donesn't need different flag settings. Default is fine.

To decode the value you must convert it from decimals to binary, and count from
right to left what bits that are 1. Look up the bit number (not value) in the
table above.

As an example on using the number 11 it's 1011 in binary. Counting from right
we see that the following bit numbers are on: 1, 2, and 4. That is the flags:

    LOG_CORE_EVENTS + LOG_GAME_EVENTS + LOG_DEBUG

Most operating systems or distributions have a calculator that can convert
between binary and decimal numbers with scientific mode enabled. An online
unit converter like below can also be used.

    <http://www.unitconversion.org/numbers/decimals-to-binary-conversion.html>


3.3.2  LIST OF MODULES

    Short name:         Description:

3.4  CUSTOM MAP CONFIGURATION FILES
-------------------------------------

Configuration files for each map is supported. They're executed after the main
configuration files are executed, and are ideal for customizing map settings.
These files are just regular configuration files and can also have standard
console commands like setting map time. These files are optional.

The main purpose of these files is to make it possible to change settings for
Zombie:Reloaded on certain maps. That could be scaling knockback, restricting
certain weapons, changing class attributes or changing ambience sound.


3.4.1  TYPES

There are two kinds of map configs; pre and post. Pre map configuration files
are executed before the modules are loaded. They're useful for changing
configuration sets for certain modules like classes. Post map configuration
files are executed after the modules are loaded. Certain stuff have to be
placed in this one to take effect, like changing class attributes.

    Type:   Executed:       Path:
    ===========================================================================
    Pre     Before modules  cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/<mapname>.cfg
    Post    After modules   cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/<mapname>.post.cfg

If not explicit specified in the module documentation, use pre configuration.


3.5  MODEL CONFIGURATION
--------------------------

Note: Work in progress. Some flags explained in this section doesn't exist yet.

The model configuration file is a list of models used on the server. Each line
contains the path including the model name, but not the file extension.

The models listed in this file are also precached when the server starts.
Custom models used, but not listed in this file will cause a "model not
precached" error on the server, so remember to list them in this file.

In addition certain flags can be added to mark the model as special, such as
only for admins/donators, hidden from random selection or only for mother
zombies.

Each line is separated into two fields with ";". The last field is optional and
if no flag is specified it's treated as a regular public model.

Model line syntax:

    <model path>[; flag]

Available flags:

    "adminonly"     - Model can only be used by admins.
    "donator"       - Model can only be used by donators.
    "hidden"        - Model is not included in random selections.
    "motherzombie"  - Model can only be used on mother zombies.

Example usages:

    models/player/zh/zh_charple001
    models/player/zh/zh_corpse002; adminonly
    models/player/zh/zh_zombie003; hidden
    models/player/ics/hellknight_red/t_guerilla; motherzombie

Put the list of models in:

    addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/models.txt


3.6  DOWNLOAD LIST
--------------------

Custom models, materials and overlays must be listed in the download list so
clients will download them. The paths must be relative to the "cstrike" folder.

List files to be downloaded in:

    addons/sourcemod/configs/zr/downloads.txt


3.7  CLASS CONFIGURATION
--------------------------

The class system makes it possible to have different zombies and humans with
customized skills. It cannot be turned off. If there is only one class in each
team, the class selections menus are automatically disabled.

The class configurations are stored in Valve's key/value format, and the file
that's loaded should be specified in the "zr_classes_file" console variable.
It's possible to change this variable with per-map configuration files to have
different sets of classes on one or more maps.

Default path is:

    configs/zr/playerclasses.txt

NOTE: The path is relative to the "sourcemod" folder.

The file contains a short description of all attributes. Details are explained
below.


3.7.1  CLASS TYPES

There are three class types; zombies, humans and admin-mode. Default classes
are selected on the player depending on console variables and the class file.

Admin-mode classes are currently incomplete and will be validated, but ignored
in the game. This is a special mode in the game, but not the same as admin-only
classes.


3.7.2  CLASS ATTRIBUTES

The list below explains all available class attributes in detail:

    Attribute:              Value type:     Limits/Requirements:
    ===========================================================================
    enabled                 text            "yes" or "no"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Enables or disables the class. Disabled classes won't show up in the
        class selection menus. Also, if some attributes failed to validate the
        class will be disabled.
    
    team                    number          0 - 2
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Specifies the class type (team ID). Class types are filtered in the
        class selection menus, so only zombies can use zombie class types, and
        only humans can use human class types. These are the allowed team IDs:
        
            0 - Zombie classes
            1 - Human classes
            2 - Admin-mode classes
        
        The admin class type sets the player in spectacting like mode, but
        allows admins to walk around. They can't take or give damage, and they
        won't affect the game rules in any way. This feature is incomplete and
        classes of this type is ignored in the game.
        
        See the "flags" attribute for admin-only classes.
    
    team_default            text            "yes" or "no"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Marks the class as the default class for its specified team. This class
        will be automatically selected on new players when they join the
        server, depending on what's specified as default in the main
        configuration file (zr_classes_default_*). If multiple classes in the
        same team is marked as default the first class marked as default is
        used.
    
    flags                   number          0 - 3
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Special class flags that are stored in a bit field (explained in 3.3,
        Logging section). Available flags:
        
        1 - Admins only. 
            Marks the class to be used by admins only. Classes with this option
            on will not be visible for regular players in the class menu.
        
        2 - Mother zombie.
            Marks the class as a mother zombie class. These classes will be
            used on mother zombies. Note that zr_classes_default_mother_zombie
            setting must be set to "motherzombies" for this flag to take
            effect.
        
        These flags can be used in a combination (1 + 2), so it could be a
        mother zombie class for admins only.

3.7.3  CLASS REQUIREMENTS

At least one zombie class and one human class with no special flags set is
required. Otherwise the plugin will fail to load.

Requirements:

    - At least one human class (teamid 1).
    - At least one zombie class (teamid 0).
    - In addition both above classes shouldn't have special flags set. They
      must be clean classes, which is flags set to "0".

Errors are logged to SourceMod error logs if it can't parse the file or if
class attributes have invalid values.

In case of incorrect values a warning will be logged and the class will be
disabled. The class index and the error flags (bit field) in the log message
tells what attributes that failed to validate.

Attribute flags:

The error flags are stored in a bit field (explained in the log configuration
in section 3.2).

Another quick way to decode it would be to use the calculator in Windows.
Enable scientific mode and enter the decimal value. Then switch to binary mode
(F8) and count from right to left what bits that are 1. Look up the bit numbers
in the table above to see what attributes that didn't validate.


3.7.4  CLASS CONSOLE VARIABLES

There are several console variables to set default class settings for players.
Place these console variables in the main configuration file:

    cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/zombiereloaded.cfg

And/or in a map config file:

    cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/<map name>[.post].cfg

Example map config files:

    cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/zm_panic.cfg
    cfg/sourcemod/zombiereloaded/zm_panic.post.cfg

Class console variables:

    Console variable:                   Default:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_config_path_playerclasses        "configs/zr/playerclasses.txt"
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Specifies what class configuration file to load. Several class
        templates can be used with map configurations.
        
        Path is relative to "sourcemod".
        
        If used in map configuration files this console variable must be placed
        in pre map configuration files. Post configuration files won't have any
        effect because the class module is done loading.

        Options:
        0 or 1


3.7.5  MODIFYING CLASS ATTRIBUTES

Classes can be modified after they're loaded. This is useful in map configs
to do stuff like scaling knockback to tune map balance.

All attributes can be modified, and some can also be scaled with a multiplier.
The value in the original class cache is multiplied with the specified value
and written back to the modified cache.

When multiplying, the value is always based on the original value, not
multiplying the earlier multiplied value. This also makes it easy to restore
the original value.

Console commands:

    Syntax:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_class_modify <class|team> <attribute> <value> [is_multiplier]
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Modify settings on one or more classes.
        
        Parameters:
        class           The class to modify. Can be any class name, or one of
                        the following team names: "all", "humans", "zombies" or
                        "admins".
        attribute       The name of the class attribute.
        value           Value to set, or multiplier if a multiplier.
        is_multiplier   Optional. Specifies wether the original value should be
                        multiplied by the specified value. Default is false.


3.7.6  ATTRIBUTE MULTIPLIERS

Making a balanced zombie map is difficult, and all maps have different balance.
The knock back and other settings may work fine on one map, but not on other
maps. This is where multipliers are useful.

With class attribute multipliers, numeric class attributes can be scaled and
configured with map configuration files. There's a set of multipliers for both
humans and zombies.

Warning: Currently these multipliers aren't validated, so using too high or
         negative values may cause unexpected behaviour, or even crash the
         plugin.

Attribute multipliers are set using this console command:

    Syntax:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_class_set_multiplier <team> <attribute> <value>
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Sets the multiplier on a class attribute.
        
        Parameters:
        team            What multiplier set to use.
                        Options: "zombies" or "humans"
        attribute       A numeric class attribute. See Class Attributes (3.7.2)
                        for details on attributes. Valid attribute multipliers:
                        "napalm_time" (zombies only)
                        "health"
                        "health_regen_interval"
                        "health_regen_amount"
                        "health_infect_gain" (zombies only)
                        "speed"
                        "knockback" (zombies only)
                        "jump_height"
                        "jump_distance"
        value           The multiplier to set. Note that a multiplier might be
                        very sensitive to big change.
                        Default: 1.0

Multipliers can also be adjusted in the zombie admin menu, but the changes
aren't saved. The menu is useful for finding the correct value, and then use it
in a map configuration file.


3.7.7  RELOAD ATTRIBUTES

While testing or adjusting class attributes they must be reloaded before they
will take effect. This only applies to players who already is the same class.

    Syntax:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_class_reload <target>
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Refreshes the player cache and reloads class attributes on one or more
        players.
        
        Parameters:
        target          Target player(s) to refresh cache on.


3.7.8  DUMPING ATTRIBUTES

For debug purposes class attributes also can be dumped.

    Syntax:
    ===========================================================================
    zr_class_dump <cachetype> <index|targetname>
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Dumps class data at a specified index in the specified cache.
        
        Parameters:
        cachetype           Cache to read from. Cache types:

3.14  VISUAL EFFECTS CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------

With visual effects it makes it possible to give a creepy ambience. It's
possible to change light style in maps and set dissolve effects on players'
bodies when they die.

It supposed to have support for adding fog, but because of technical limits in
SourceMod it's not possible yet. For developers who wonder why, it's because
it must be a env_fog_controller entity in the map. That entity isn't networked
so SourceMod can't modify or create that entity type. SourceMod may get this
feature in future versions.

Currently it doesn't support any other custom files than the ambience file.
Other sounds are pre-configured. Instead it's possible to specify how often
the sounds should be played, if enabled.

The lenght of the ambience file must be specified because SourceMod currently
can't detect lenght of MP3 files.

        0 or 1


3.17  SPAWN COMMAND CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------

The spawn command (zspawn) lets players join the game late, depending on the
time configured. To avoid abusing, there are settings that decides what team to

4.7  PHYSICS STUFF
--------------------

There are glitches and simplified physics stuff that can be used to get an
advantage. Some servers may not allow all of these tricks.


4.7.1  GLITCHING THROUGH WALLS

(bad thing to do, and should not be allowed)


4.7.2  JUMPING THROUGH NON-SOLID PROPS

Realistic physics in multiplayer games is a expensive task for the server and
it appears to be laggy for players. The solution to this is simplified physics
on props (that is simplified collision detection).

Some props aren't solid but pushes players away from it's origin (center of the
object). This is NOT a engine bug, but a simplified solution. These props are
useful to _delay_ zombies in barricades, but they're still fair to use. If
players got enough speed they can run and jump through them.

There's another trick that works quite good if the knock back is balanced
correctly. If a player look straight down or straight up it's possible to
simply walk through non-solid props, or at the same time, jumping slowly
through them.


4.7.3  JUMPING FAST IN SMALL AREAS

When zombies have to crouch to enter a area where humans camp (like tubes and
vents), jumping fast helps a lot.

When jumping it's not easy for humans to hit the head and they can't get that
good knock back anymore. With multiple zombies jumping fast, pushing eachother
on their way into a tube, the humans are doomed. The tube camping problem much
better balanced.
