2010.06.03 - r613
-------------------

* Fixed signatures and round end defines that were updated in CS:S OB.


2010.07.25 - r633
-------------------

* Added support for different speed methods, defaulted to prop offset method.
  See the manual for more information about the class speed attribute.
  Important: Class speeds and spawn protection speed must be updated! Use this
  conversion formula:
      prop speed offset = ((lmv speed / 300) * 250) - 250
  If you don't want to update speed values right now, use
  "zr_classes_speed_method lmv" in zombiereloaded.cfg for backwards
  compatibility.
* Added 'explode' suicide command from OB update to intercept list (bug 190).
* Removed unnecessary antistick commands for model hull width, all models have
  the same hull width.
* Removed hint sound on hp display and spawn protection timer. Credits goes to
  to Tauphi.
* Fixed an error that happened when buying ammo and not having a weapon in
  prim/sec slot.
* Fixed class menus being disabled and not checking if the player have access
  to private classes.
* Fixed client not connected error in class module.
* Updated compiler. ZR now requires SourceMod 1.3 or newer.


2010.08.28 - r643
-------------------

* Fixed function signatures that were changed after a CS update. Credit goes to
  psychonic.
* Fixed class speed multiplier not properly applied with prop speed method (bug
  199).
* Fixed invalid handle error in ZMarket module (bug 152).
* Fixed a rare case where removing weapons didn't work.
* Possibly fixed invalid handle error with WeaponsEntityToDisplay (bug 163).
* Lowered sv_maxspeed to work around a acceleration issue with spectators.
* Added validation error messages for individual attributes when loading
  classes. Easier than reading bits from a number.
* Improved confusing description of the NVGs class attribute.

2010.10.15 - r644
-------------------

* Changed default speed method to LMV because prop speed offsets are broken at
  the moment. This will introduce some side effects again; jump and fall speed
  is affected. Weapon recoil is also affected, but it's not confirmed that it
  has negative impact on bullets or aiming itself.
  Note: Those who already changed speed method back to LMV don't need this
  patch.

2010.11.14 - r647
-------------------

* Added external plugin API for ZR with basic infection and respawn tools. The
  following natives and forwards are now available:
      ZR_IsClientZombie
      ZR_IsClientHuman
      ZR_InfectClient
      ZR_HumanClient
      ZR_OnClientInfect
      ZR_OnClientInfected
      ZR_OnClientHuman
      ZR_OnClientHumanPost
      ZR_RespawnClient
      ZR_OnClientRespawn
      ZR_OnClientRespawned
      ZR_SetKilledByWorld
      ZR_GetKilledByWorld
  See addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/zr in the package for details.
  Also see addons/sourcemod/scripting/testsuite/zr for API usage examples.

  everyone will remain on the terrorists team.
